# Project
Repo for the project
# Abstract : 

In the last 4-5 years, we have seen many new lifestyle trends (veganism, minimalism, nofap, juice cleansing, intermittent fasting, ...), and we have seen all sorts of opinions about them which tend to differ through different regions and different years. These opinions are especially very clear on social media, such as twitter. 
In this project, we intend to use sentiment analysis to see how twitter users view these new trends and how much it changes through the years and through different regions of the world and/or different language speakers.

After doing the analysis described above, we hope to find a way to know what lifestyles have especially helped people's lives to change for the better, which means we will have to analyze what people that live these lives are posting about their changes and see how positive they are.

# Research Questions :  
- What regions like which new lifestyle better?
- What regions has seen the most change viewing a given trend?
- What trends has had the most change in terms of how people view them?
- Is there a possible explanation to how these potential changes happened?
- Which lifestyles have affected twitter user's lives for better the most?

# Dataset 

The dataset that will be used is the twitter dataset (the global one), we might also use the swiss tweets dataset.

# A list of internal milestones up until project milestone 2

- Find a list of keywords to look for in the twitter dataset to find our target lifestyles tweets that we want to analyze.
- Filter out the ones with very few tweets.
- Learn how to use sentiment analysis on text to find out people's opinions.

# Questions for TAs

- Is the second part described in the absract feasible?
- Is there a way to find out where the twitter users are located?
